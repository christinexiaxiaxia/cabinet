		<p>
			5 × 7 in hardcover book, 184 pages. <br><br>
			Essentially Anonymous is a two-part installation comprised of two books, one that can touched and flipped through and another that is out-of-reach and unknowable. Both books are comprised of expedition photographs collected from the American Museum of Natural History’s digital archives; the untouchable book in the corner is filled with nameless photographs of people taken by researchers during these expeditions while the in-reach book puts the faces of said researchers on display for viewers to examine. These images are interspersed with a poem addressing the conflicts within the act of speaking for others and documenting experiences outside of your own.

		<p>
			24 × 18 in prints. <br><br>
			<i>Save Us All!</i> is an edition of prints that satirizes The Royal Family’s perfectly planned and measured public image to highlight the gossip and tabloid news that keeps the family relevant and present in popular culture. While exaggerating the monarchy’s grandeur by transforming their balcony photo from the Trooping the Colour ceremony into the image of saints, these “holy” portraits are overlayed with loud and brash text—the background is composed of tabloid articles that gossip and speculate about the family’s lives and the foreground consists of the words from God Save the Queen stretched, scaled, and transformed into eye-catching headlines and titles.

		<p>
			Gouache painting (12 × 15 in outer frame, 9.5 × 7.5 in within mat). <br><br>
			<i>Amazing Grace</i> was originally written as a poem in 1772 and over the past 250 or so years it has transformed into the cultural artifact it is today. With its origins rooted in the hopeful salvation of a slavetrader, its reclamation as an anthem of solidarity throughout the Civil Rights Movement and onwards, and its subsequent mainstream popularization through endless covers by established musicians, the Christian hymn has held many meanings throughout its life. The six recordings on the webpage were collected from the Library of Congress’ collection for <i>Amazing Grace</i>.<br><br>

		<p class="title item" id="">Exhibition (unlit)</p>
		<p>
			24 × 9.5 in prints (edition of 6). <br><br>
			<i>Exhibition</i> is an edition of prints addressing visibility, the disinterment of people’s pasts, and the question of “who has the right to speak for others?”. The themes and ideas within this work are heavily based upon Susan Sontag’s Regarding the Pain of Others.

		<p>
			8.5 × 11 in page. <br><br>
			These are a collection of quotes collected from local taxidermy business websites. The use of the term <i>trophy</i> is meant to refer to the hunted animals, but when explicit mention of the taxidermy is removed, the phrases begin to take new meaning.

		<p class="title item" id="">Do Not Print</p>
		<p>
			3 × 4 in flip books. <br><br>
			These flip books consist of negatives collected from the Library of Congress that contain images marked to not be printed. Originally documented by the Farm Security Administration to preserve rural and folk life across the United States, these images have redundantly been marked to never have a second life. The hole-punching in and of itself is such a destructive act for the purposes of an archive, meant to preserve aspects of life and culture. Separate from their original purpose, these images have become something more formally playful—flip books that bounce and guide the ominous black orb created by the hole-punching across the frames.

		<p class="title item" id="">Human Artifacts</p>
		<p>
			5 × 7 in paperback book, 384 pages (edition of 6). <br><br>
			<i>Human Artifacts</i> is an anthology of algorithmically-made stories that reveal the ways in which our digital culture can artificially reflect intimate emotional experiences. Trained from ImageNet’s non-human categories, images were bred together to create morphing sequences that somehow still capture human-like figures. Despite the categories not meant to portray humans, the few people that have snuck into other categories of objects and landscapes are able to creep their way in to the series of uncanny images. Although the algorithm that produced these photos are not meant to recognize a human figure, they are still able to tell a narrative.

		<p class="title item" id="">Grave Eternity (installation)</p>
		<p>
			14 × 24 in screen with frame, staple gun, and computer mouse. <br><br>
			<i>Grave Eternity</i> is a web-based installation and performance piece that requires participants to take a few minutes to respond to a portrait of the man featured in the frame through drawing or writing. I then collect people’s contributions and use a staple gun to violently attach them to the wall, surrounding the frame with eclectic and mostly uninformed reactions to the subject of the image. <br><br>

The man in the image is Francis Galton, one of the early contributors of racial sciences and creator of term <i>eugenics</i>—the practice of correlating physiology to intellect and taking action and affecting policy to reflect their beliefs. This piece is an act of disenchantment towards Galton—an “anti-shrine”, unceremonious and misinformed. It removes the power of controlling his own public perception by re-appropriating his image and his personal history to endlessly loop and generate. Similarly to how the photos of anonymous individuals documented during expeditions rest in archives or databases completely separated from any shred of their actual humanity or real self, I have created a ritual and “alter” to create the same experience for this scientist, no longer allowing his image rest peacefully.
